### :rotating_light: Known Issues + Feedback

Known Issues: Error handling messages flicker instead of staying until the user enters another item. Also, whenever closing the window I get graphics.py error message - I think it may be because of the While loop but was not able to get rid of it. Planned on adding BST to sort the items of the shopping cart to the output but I spent too much time on the UI and fixing errors.

Feedback: Great assignemnt! My goal here was to solve the health problem that America is facing right now. I think the issue there is that people don't know exactly what foods are healthy and which ones are not. This application I wrote allows the user to see in real-time what are the good and bad choices in their shopping cart and motivates them to make better decisions.
